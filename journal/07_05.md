For the development of the NN and the system in general it han been deduced **three** lines of investigation:

```
*NN ---¬
       |> Improve NN 
       |          |----> 1.  Rebuild and optimize the image
       |          |----> 2.  Seek for NN optimization (GPU, libraries)
       |
       |> Train the NN
                  |----> 3.  Change NN classes, only 3 (extinguisher, door, exit sign)
                  |----> 4.  Increase the dataset
                  |----> 5.  Retrain until a better performance

* System performance ¬
                     |-> 6.  Solution with two pipelines
                     |-> 7.  Solution using the 3s and object traking between frames

* New Features ---¬
                   |---> 8.  How to perform object tracking
                   |---> 9.  How to meassure distances between objects
                   |---> 10. How to compute rotation angle
                   |---> 11. How to draw features in the map
       
```
