## Image
A new image has been generated, with name version **mate_v07**. I this new image the following changes has been implemented:
* Installation of the library image[array], which is used for the image capture --> *pip install picamera[array]*
* In the directory of the *roe_detector*, new directories has been introduced in order to guess the checkpoint data.

## Entrypoint
* In order to get acces to the camera from the docker container, it should perform the following operation:
```bash
cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ && echo "/opt/vc/lib" >> 00-vmcs.conf  && ldconfig
```

* The checkpoint load has been added:
```bash
## We will add NN checkpoint
cp checkpoint.zip /catkin_ws/src/roe_detector/scripts/data/model_checkpoints
cd /catkin_ws/src/roe_detector/scripts/data/model_checkpoints && unzip checkpoint.zip && rm checkpoint.zip
```
* For making possible to acces code from the source files in the same directory, we have to add a __init__.py file, that will be interpreted by python like "It's ok, you can import code from the same directory":
```bash
echo "#!/usr/bin/env python" >> __init__.py && chmod +x __init__.py
```
