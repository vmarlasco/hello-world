Due to the **performance problem** related with the size of the images, the next steps in the projects are creating a new dataset
for the new resolution of **640X480 px** and reatrain the NN. In order to correctly train the NN, a new function is going to be 
added in order to compare both, training and validation sets.

**Tasks:**
* Create a new dataset for the proper resolution.
* Modify and adatp the NN for the new resolution.
* Add the new features to the training process.


## Adapt the NN
For adapting the NN to the new resoltuion, we have to take in account that it is composed among other layers, by 4 Conv layers
with padding 2, what it means that our new feature map is **40X30** size.

In roe_squeezeDet_config:
```python
########################################################################### 

  mc.IMAGE_WIDTH           = 640
  mc.IMAGE_HEIGHT          = 480
  
###########################################################################
  H, W, B = 30, 40, 9
```

## Eval monitoring 
In order to both monitoring train and eval dataset, we have to slihtly modify the train process, in order to, each *summary_step*,
compute as normally the loss and probability for the train batch, but we will also reload some images from the **eval dataset** and
compute the required data. **IT IS VERY IMPORTANT** not to include **model.train_op** within the list of run process, in order not
modify the training process with evaluation data.

> It has been wonderful to discover about how they are called the functions as method variables.
