On the one hand, by mean of an ethernet connection, both are connecetd in the net *192.168.5.0 (255.255.255)*. This connection has been stablished in order to work in any place, avoiding slow connection. On the other hand both devices are connected to Internet with Wi-Fi interfaces. This net does not present a fix ip, because it is going to depend on the working place.
