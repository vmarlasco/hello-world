# 14th of August

## Errors
* Reference frame: the problem about changing meassures was due to the reading of different coordinates frames. We were reading from "base_scan", "base_link" and "odom". **Solution**: the solution was based on filtering the meassures with an additional node named *robotPositionBroadcaster.py*.

* Since we were using a different frame for the data representation "base_link", the meassures appeared shifted and rotated from the origin. 

* An additional topic needed "ROE/RobotPose"

## Considerations
* Until the walls are added to the map, it is no possible to include the detected objects because of the lack of certainty in the representation.

* The extinguisher model of long tube is not detected in a proper way -->**Retrain NN**
